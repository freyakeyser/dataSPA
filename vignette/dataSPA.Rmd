# dataSPA Package:A Package for Obtaining Data for DFO Strategic Planning
## Jaimie Harbin

The `dataSPA` package is intended to be used by Department Of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employees to obtain data from A) the Project Planning Tool (PPT) API and B) Salary Spread sheets to plot information related to allocation of funding.

Some disclaimers/ assumptions with this package include:

1. For this package to work, you must be on the DFO VPN
2. This code assumes some employees have not changed positions over the course of their career
3. As of 2023/05/23, in some cases when a employment classification is not provided, it us assumed the employee was a PC-2.
4. The salary calculations are based off of medians of federal employee pay scales for the year of the projects fiscal year, not the exact salary of individuals. If the pay information for a specific year is not available, the closest year is found. As negotiations continue to happen, the `data(salaries)` built in dataset will need to be updated.
5. Calculated over time salary does not consider the fact
sometimes overtime may be 1.5X or 2X regular salary
6. When a person with job classification EX is associated with a
project, they are not included in total weeks or salary.
7. For salary predictions in `plotSPA(which="salaryPredict")`, overtime is not accounted for and it is assumed that each classification level worked the same amount of hours as the previous year
8. The PPT was only mandated in the Maritimes region 2 years ago


To install the package, you must first be a collaborator of the private repository `dataSPA` hosted by `j-harbin` (Jaimie Harbin). Once you have been granted access, run the following code to install the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# configure github and generate token
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YourName", user.email = "your@mail.com")
usethis::create_github_token() 

# paste your personal access token into pop-up that follows...
credentials::set_github_pat()

install.packages("devtools") # optional
devtools::install_github("j-harbin/dataSPA")
library(dataSPA)
```

Once the package is installed, the user should follow the following workflow to successfully use the package:


```{r fig1,fig.width=8.5,fig.height=3,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1}Figure 1: Work flow for the `dataSPA` package",echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph flowchart {
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']

      # edge definitions with the node IDs
      tab1 -> tab2;
      }

      [1]: 'getData()'
      [2]: 'createReport()'
      ")
```

## getData()

If `type` is `om`, this function extracts data from the om-costs project planning tool (PPT) API (http://dmapps/api/ppt/om-costs/) and combines it with the fiscal year from the project_years API (http://dmapps/api/ppt/). If `type` is `salary`, this function obtains the data from the staff API (http://dmapps/api/ppt/staff/) and combines it with information from a Human Resources (HR) spreadsheet.

It should be noted that this function will only work for authorized Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employees. As shown in the help documentation for this function (`?getData`), a `cookie` is required. A `cookie` can be obtained by DFO staff and will need to be updated every few weeks by following the steps outlined below:

**1. Sign into DMApps on the internet**

**2. Right click in DMApps and click "Inspect Panel".**

![Figure 2: Right click to find "Inspect"](inspect.png)

**3. Click the + button to the right of "Elements" and click on "Application"**

![Figure 3: Click >> to find "Application"](application.png)

**4. Under "Cookies" on the left, click on "http://dmapps" to find your csrftoken and sessionid and copy their value**

**5. Assign a variable in R with the following format:**

```
cookie <- "csrftoken=YOURTOKEN; sessionid=YOURSESSIONID"
```
This variable `cookie` will then act as your `cookie` argument in the `getData()` function, e.g.:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

om <- getData(type="om", cookie=cookie, keep=TRUE, path=".") # Notice keep = TRUE saves the file, and the path argument says where to save it
sal <- getData(type="salary", cookie=cookie, keep=TRUE, path=".") # Notice these are saved in the same path 
omdate <- getData(type="om_date", cookie=cookie, keep=TRUE, path=".") # Notice this is saved in the same path and done AFTER type=”om”
```

## plotSPA()

This function plots specific graphs (determined by the which argument) using the data frames returned by `getData()`. It is used in the `createReport()` function.

The various plot types are as follows:

* For `which="omBar"`, a bar graph representing amount of money ($) coded by funding type and show the number of deliverables and milestones per year in blue and red respectively

* For `which="omAllocation"` Line graphs representing changes in O&M investment for categories over the years for a specific project. Average rate of change per year for each category, where applicable, displayed on the graph in red


* For `which="salaryBar"` a bar graph representing amount of salary money ($) using the median values of a specific job classification. Graph color coded by funding type indicated by the legend.

* For `which="salaryAllocation"`Line graphs representing changes in Salary investment for different classifications over the years for a specific project. Average rate of change per year for each category, where applicable, displayed on the graph in red

* For `which="indeterminate"` a bar graph representing percentage (%) of Indeterminate vs Non-indeterminate employees for project years.Number of staff shown on the figure in red

* For `which="predictSalary"` a bar chat showing the trends of salary increasing while funding amount remains the same.Note: This plot does
not include amount of overtime as that is hard to predict.

* For `which="predictOM` a bar chart showing the trends of om
increasing while funding amoutn remains the same. This plot
assumes an inflation rate of 2%.

* For `which="overviewStatus"` a pie chart is created that shows the
number of projects for each of the following status': Approved,
Draft, Submitted, and Reviews for the specified parameters.

* For `which="overviewInvestment"` a bar chart indicating how much
money was spent on A) OM investment (if an om argument is provided),
B) Salary investment (if a salary argument is provided), or C)
OM and Salary investment (if both om & salary argument given).
Note: This includes overtime salary amount.

To plot the amount of money invested in O&M per funding type for the Snow crab project, for example, the code is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotSPA(om, which="omBar", id=1093)
```

![Figure 3 Bar graph representing amount of money ($) invested in O&M per funding type for project years 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 for the snow crab project (# 1093). Graph color coded by funding type indicated by the legend. ](om.png)

# createReport()

This function creates a fact sheet report for a specified project id or theme. Example code is shown below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
createReport(om=om, salary=salary, id=1093, cookie=cookie, path=".", destdir="../reports") 

# Notice the path is set to the same place as the saved data. This allows the report to print out what date the data was pulled
```
